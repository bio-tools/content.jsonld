      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | An Automated Protocol for Free Energy Calculations of Protein Mutations in Q | Predicting the effect of single-point mutations on protein stability or protein-ligand binding is a major challenge in computational biology. Free energy calculations constitute the most rigorous approach to this problem, though the estimation of converged values for amino acid mutations remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, we developed tailored protocols to calculate free energy shifts associated with single-point mutations. We herein describe the QresFEP protocol, which includes an extension of our recent protocols to cover all amino acids mutations, based on the latest versions of the OPLS-AA force field. QresFEP is implemented in an application programming interface framework and the graphic interface QGui, for the molecular dynamics software Q",
