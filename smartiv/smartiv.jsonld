Predicts motifs from enriched k-mers that combine information from ranked RNA sequences and their predicted secondary structure, obtained using various folding methods. Consequently, SMARTIV generates Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in a combined sequence and structure alphabet with assigned P-values.",
