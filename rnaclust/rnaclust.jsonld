  "sc:description": "It requires as input a multiple FASTA file. In the first step for each input sequence the base pair probability matrix of its secondary structure distribution is calculated. Secondly, for each pair of base pair probability matrices a sequence-structure alignment is calculated. Lastly, a hierarchical cluster-tree is derived by WPGMA clustering of the pairwise alignment distances and the optimal number of clusters is calculated from the tree.",
