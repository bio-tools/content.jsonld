DIFFERENT) bio.tools/ghost | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IQ-TREE' (bio.tools/iq-tree) | Recovering Historical Signal from Heterotachously-evolved Sequence Alignments | Molecular sequence data that have evolved under the influence of heterotachous evolutionary processes are known to mislead phylogenetic inference. We introduce the General Heterogeneous evolution On a Single Topology (GHOST) model of sequence evolution, implemented under a maximum-likelihood framework in the phylogenetic program IQ-TREE (http: www.iqtree.org). Simulations show that using the GHOST model, IQ-TREE can accurately recover the tree topology, branch lengths and substitution model parameters from heterotachously-evolved sequences. We investigate the performance of the GHOST model on empirical data by sampling phylogenomic alignments of varying lengths from a plastome alignment",
