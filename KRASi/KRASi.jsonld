Resistance to targeted therapies is common and likely to limit long-term efficacy of KRAS inhibitors (KRASi). To identify pathways of adaptation to KRASi and to predict drug combinations that circumvent resistance, we used a mass spectrometry-based quantitative temporal proteomics and bioinformatics workflow to profile the temporal proteomic response to KRAS G12C inhibition in pancreatic and lung cancer 2D and 3D cellular models. We quantified 10,805 proteins across our datasets, representing the most comprehensive KRASi proteomics effort to date. Our data reveal common mechanisms of acute and long-term response between KRAS G12C -driven tumors",
