The purpose of this review article was to identify evidence-based interventions for speech, language, and literacy used with DHH multilingual learners (DMLs), monolingual DHH learners, and hearing bilingual learners without hearing loss. Interventions used with these groups can inform the practice of professionals providing services to DMLs. Method This review article considered speech, language, and literacy interventions used with DHH and hearing bilingual learners from birth to 21 years of age",
