      "sc:description": "Protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models. It is a general approach that uses BioHEL, a rule-based evolutionary classifier, to describe the expression samples as a set of rules and then infers interactions between genes that act together within rules to predict the samples class. It generates co-prediction networks, that capture biological knowledge complementary to that contained in popular similarity-based co-expression networks.",
