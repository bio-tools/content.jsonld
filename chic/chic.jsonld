  "sc:description": "Quality control pipeline for ChIP-seq data using a comprehensive set of quality control metrics, including previously proposed metrics as well as novel ones, based on local characteristics of the enrichment profile. The framework allows assessing quality of samples with sharp or broad enrichment profiles, whereas previously proposed metrics were not taking this into account. It provides a reference compendium of quality control metrics and trained machine learning models for scoring samples.",
