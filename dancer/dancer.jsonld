  "sc:description": "Digital Anatomy Constructor is a program that can be used to reconstruct anatomical pictures. In general, it fills color into drawn shapes that collectively form a picture that represents the data. The main data source of this program is microarray data, but in situ hybridization-, Northern Blot-, Southern Blot- or any other data can be used. As a result, a picture is produced where the shapes are filled with color that corresponds to the gene expression level.",
