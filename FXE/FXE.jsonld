      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Scientific instrument Femtosecond X-ray Experiments (FXE) | The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) delivers extremely intense (>1012 photons pulse-1 and up to 27000 pulses s-1), ultrashort (<100 fs) and transversely coherent X-ray radiation, at a repetition rate of up to 4.5 MHz. Its unique X-ray beam parameters enable novel and groundbreaking experiments in ultrafast photochemistry and material sciences at the Femtosecond X-ray Experiments (FXE) scientific instrument. This paper provides an overview of the currently implemented experimental baseline instrumentation and its performance during the commissioning phase, and a preview of planned improvements. FXE's versatile instrumentation combines the simultaneous application of forward X-ray scattering and X-ray spectroscopy techniques with femtosecond time resolution",
