      "sc:description": "Prediction of mRNA subcellular localization using deep recurrent neural networks | RNATracker is a deep learning approach to learn mRNA subcellular localization patterns and to infer its outcome. It operates on the cDNA of the longest isoformic protein-coding transcript of a gene with or without its corresponding secondary structure annnotations. The learning targets are fractions/percentage of the transcripts being localized to a fixed set of subcellular compartments of interest",
