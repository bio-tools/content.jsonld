From this website one can emulate the behaviour of a microphone array along with the required Signal Processing Chain. It is also possible to compute captured samples from measurements with microphones. After computation, the results can be visualized in both 2D and 3D. Launching emulations and visualizing results can be done by using the tools provided at the download section | A few steps are required before one can launch emulations and visualize results: | Create an account on our platform. We kindly ask to provide the full name, e-mail address and institution of affiliation | Each account needs to be approved by the administrator of the tool",
