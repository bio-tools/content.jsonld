It automatically generates a \"tube map\"-like visualization of sequence graphs which have been created with vg | Link to working demo: https://vgteam.github.io/sequenceTubeMap/ | Run Sequence Tube Maps On Your Own | If you are using vg and want visualize the graphs it generates, the online version is limited to small file sizes. For visualizing bigger data sets you can run Sequence Tube Maps on your own. You can either run Tube Maps completely on your local (Linux) machine or use your local browser to access Tube Maps running on any other (Linux) machine you have access to",
