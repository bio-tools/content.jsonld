      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Framework for the Inference of In Situ Interaction Kinetics from Single-Molecule Imaging Data | Recent experimental and computational developments have been pushing the limits of live-cell single-molecule imaging, enabling the monitoring of intermolecular interactions in their native environment with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, interactions are captured only for the labeled subset of molecules, which tends to be a small fraction. As a result, it has remained a challenge to calculate molecular interaction kinetics, in particular association rates, from live-cell single-molecule tracking data. To overcome this challenge, we developed a mathematical modeling-based Framework for the Inference of in Situ Interaction Kinetics (FISIK) from single-molecule imaging data with substoichiometric labeling",
