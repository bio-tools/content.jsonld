Using a gene or protein identifier as a query, this database provides comprehensive, combined information on orthologs in other species using data from five independent resources: KOGs, Inparanoid, Homologene, OrthoMCL, and a table of curated orthologs between budding yeast and fission yeast. Associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms of orthologs can also be retrieved.",
