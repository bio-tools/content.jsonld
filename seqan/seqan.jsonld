Our library applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other libraries. The library is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance. Additionally, it includes several ready-made command line tools for common tasks in sequence analysis.",
