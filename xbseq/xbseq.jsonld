      "sc:description": "This algorithm establishes an statistical model based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution of true expression signals and sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions are considered as sequencing noises that follow a Poisson distribution. Given measureable observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data, true expression signals can be identified, assuming that they are governed by the negative binomial distribution.",
