The Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) tool has been broadly disseminated in the literature. This study set out to identify PA assistance programs among Brazilian students and analyze them using the RE-AIM tool. The search was conducted in the Lilacs, SportDiscus, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhot, PsycINFO and PubMed databases. After thoroughly researching titles, abstracts and studies, 15 articles (seven PA assistance programs) were included",
