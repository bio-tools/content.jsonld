  "sc:description": "Program for robust automatic backbone assignment of 13C/15N labeled proteins. It can be applied independent of the assignment complexity, it does not require tight thresholds for establishing sequential connectivity or detailed adjustment of these thresholds, it can work with a wide variety of NMR experiments and it is robust against missing chemical shift information. In case of a known 3D structure, residual dipolar couplings can be used to enhance assignment.",
