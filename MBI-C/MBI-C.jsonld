DESIGN:This was a population-based cohort study. SETTING:Participants were recruited from the Platform for Research Online to Investigate Genetics and Cognition in Aging study (https: www.protect-exeter.org.uk). PARTICIPANTS:A total of 5,742 participant-informant dyads participated in the study. MEASUREMENTS:Both participants and informants completed the MBI-C",
