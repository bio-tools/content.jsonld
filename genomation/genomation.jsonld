The genomic intervals represent regions with a defined chromosomic position, which may be associated with a score, such as aligned reads from HT-seq experiments, TF binding sites, methylation scores, etc. The package can use any tabular genomic feature data as long as it has minimal information on the locations of genomic intervals.",
