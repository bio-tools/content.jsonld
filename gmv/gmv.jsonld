  "sc:description": "The pipeline runs PRODIGAL gene predictions on all genomes, runs pan-reciprocal BLAST, and identifies ortholog sets. For a set of orthologous genes, if the positions of the PRODIGAL selected starts coincide in a multiple sequence alignment, they are accepted. If they do not coincide, a consistent start position is sought where a majority of the highest-scoring PRODIGAL selected sites coincide. If such a position is found, it is accepted, and the predictions are changed for the outlying genes.",
