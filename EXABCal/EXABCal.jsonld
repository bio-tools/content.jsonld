      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'photon', 'buildup' | A program for calculating photon exposure and energy absorption buildup factors | This research presents a new Windows compatible program (EXABCal) for photon exposure and energy absorption buildup factors for standard energy grid from 0.015- 15 MeV for elements, mixtures and compound. This program was written using Python programming language and the calculation of buildup factors was based on the well-known Geometric Progression (GP) fitting procedure. The equivalent atomic numbers and GP fitting parameters of mixtures and compounds can also be evaluated using this program",
