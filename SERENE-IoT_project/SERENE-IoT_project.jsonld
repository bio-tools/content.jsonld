The role and the involvement of the stakeholders are explained, as well their interaction in the ecosystem. We focus on how the synergy between partners improves efficiency, boosts product development and accelerates market access. The spiral of the innovation concept is introduced to illustrate the different stages ensuring the correct development of a medical technology. This iterative cycle drives the product maturation, according to medical needs and feedback, and ensures the correct implementation of the innovation in the clinical framework",
