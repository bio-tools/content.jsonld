      "sc:description": "We have developed a range of practical scripts, together with their corresponding Galaxy wrappers, that make scRNA-seq training and quality-control accessible to researchers previously daunted by the prospect of scRNA-seq analysis. We implement a ‘visualise-filter-visualise’ paradigm through simple command-line tools that use the Loom format to exchange data between the tools. The point-and-click nature of Galaxy makes it easy to assess, visualise, and filter scRNA-seq data from short-read sequencing data.",
