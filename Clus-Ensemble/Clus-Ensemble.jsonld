This framework unifies unsupervised clustering and predictive modelling and allows for a natural extension to more complex prediction settings such as multi-task learning and multi-label classification | Clus is co-developed by the Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence group of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and the Department of Knowledge Technologies of the Jo≈æef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia | Clus is free software (licensed under the GPL) and can be obtained from this website",
