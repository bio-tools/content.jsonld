      "sc:description": "Hierarchical Structured Component analysis of microRNA-mRNA integration model is a novel statistical method to find biological relationship, efficiently study and identify such integrated markers. It could use subgroup information, it yelded more results, as related to phenotypes, than those of other existing methods that lack network information. It can be easily applied to other cancer studies to identify miRNA-mRNA integration sets for early diagnosis and prognosis.",
