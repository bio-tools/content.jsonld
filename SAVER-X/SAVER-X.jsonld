Take a look at our free SAVER-X web-server for the transfer learning online computation! We also encourage you to read our pre-print manucript for more information. You can also refer to our earlier denoising method SAVER | Laboratory for single Cell data science | Where Statistics, Biology and Computer Science Meet | Uploading Data is as Easy as 1-2-3: | Researchers can directly upload their data of UMI counts to the web portal as a (gene x cell) matrix stored in a .csv, .txt or .rds file. Our cloud service does not store the user’s data or use it for any other purpose besides denoising | In most single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) studies, the data are extremely sparse and noisy, hindering downstream analyses",
