      "sc:description": "fastPHASE is a program to estimate missing genotypes and unobserved haplotypes. It is an implementation of the model described in Scheet & Stephens (2006). This is a cluster-based model for haplotype variation, and gains its utility from implicitly modeling the genealogy of chromosomes in a random sample from a population as a tree but summarizing all haplotype variation in the \"tips\" of the trees.",
