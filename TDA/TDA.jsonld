Using the data, we will show how to construct Betti plots from weighted brain graphs, where the weights are Pearson correlations. Then show how to perform the exact topological inference and obtain the p-value on the Betti plots. The Betti plots are the basic data visualization technique in persistent homology but statistical inference procedure has been lacking in the field [1,2,3]. New exact topological inference framework is developed for determining statistical significance of Betti plots | The codes have been tested with MacBook Pro with MATLAB 2016",
