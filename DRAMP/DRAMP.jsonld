Peptides in this database come from three sources : Public databases (Swiss-Prot, PDB, PubMed), Clinical antimicrobial peptides (preclinical and clinical) and Patents | DRAMP(Data repository of antimicrobial peptides) is an open-access and manually curated database harboring diverse annotations of AMPs including sequences, structures, activities, physicochemical, patent, clinical and reference information | We are responsible for maintaining the website daily and updating the database regularly",
