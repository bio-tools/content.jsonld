      "sc:description": "Assembling Exon Using Gene Capture Data | Exon capture across species has been one of the most broadly applied approaches to acquire multi-locus data in phylogenomic studies of non-model organisms. Methods for assembling loci from short-read sequences (eg, Illumina platforms) that rely on mapping reads to a reference genome may not be suitable for studies comprising species across a wide phylogenetic spectrum; thus, de novo assembling methods are more generally applied. Current approaches for assembling targeted exons from short reads are not particularly optimized as they cannot (1) assemble loci with low read depth, (2) handle large files efficiently, and (3) reliably address issues with paralogs. Thus, we present Assexon: a streamlined pipeline that de novo assembles targeted exons and their flanking sequences from raw reads",
