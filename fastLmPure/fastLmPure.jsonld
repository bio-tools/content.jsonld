      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Single-RunKing', 'barebones' | Genome-wide barebones regression scan for mixed-model association analysis | KEY MESSAGE:Based on the simplified FaST-LMM, wherein genomic variance is replaced with heritability, we have significantly improved computational efficiency by implementing rapid R fastLmPure to statistically infer the genetic effects of tested SNPs and focus on large or highly significant SNPs obtained using the EMMAX algorithm. For a genome-wide mixed-model association analysis, we introduce a barebones linear model fitting function called fastLmPure from the R RcppArmadillo package for the rapid estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects and the maximum likelihood values of factored spectrally transformed linear mixed models (FaST-LMM)",
