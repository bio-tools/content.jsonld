      "sc:description": "Hi-C is a powerful technology for studying genome-wide chromatin interactions. However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data. We present a novel reproducibility measure that systematically takes these features into consideration. This measure can assess pairwise differences between Hi-C matrices under a wide range of settings, and can be used to determine optimal sequencing depth.",
