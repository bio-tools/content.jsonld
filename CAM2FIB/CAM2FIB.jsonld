      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'G-code', 'machining', 'beam', 'FIB machining' | Computer-aided manufacturing and focused ion beam technology enable machining of complex micro- and nano-structures | Interpretation and interpolation of G-code for creating stream files for FIB/SEM instruments | Program for interpretation and interpolation of G-code to create stream files for FIB/SEM instruments | The currently implemented output format is designed for use with an FEI Helios NanoLab G3 instrument, but may easily be adapted to other instruments. This code accepts most G-code files as an input and was tested with the G-code dialects RS274D, WinCNC and FreeCAD. In its current implementation the overall patterning time is equally distributed over all patterning points. Machining or printing of 3D-structures is therefore currently limited to layered structures. Please read the manual for further instructions on installing and running the interpreter program",
