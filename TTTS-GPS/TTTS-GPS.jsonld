It is characterized by abnormal vascular connections in the placenta that cause blood to flow unevenly between the babies. If left untreated, perinatal mortality occurs in 90% of cases, whilst neurological injuries are still present in TTTS survivors. Minimally invasive fetoscopic laser surgery is the standard and optimal treatment for this condition, but is technically challenging and can lead to complications. Acquiring and maintaining the required surgical skills need consistent practice, and a steep learning curve. An accurate preoperative planning is thus vital for complex TTTS cases",
