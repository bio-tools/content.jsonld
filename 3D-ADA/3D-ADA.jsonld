      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'xulabs' | Adversarial domain adaptation for cross data source macromolecule in situ structural classification in cellular electron cryo-tomograms | MOTIVATION:Since 2017, an increasing amount of attention has been paid to the supervised deep learning-based macromolecule in situ structural classification (i.e. subtomogram classification) in cellular electron cryo-tomography (CECT) due to the substantially higher scalability of deep learning. However, the success of such supervised approach relies heavily on the availability of large amounts of labeled training data. For CECT, creating valid training data from the same data source as prediction data is usually laborious and computationally intensive. It would be beneficial to have training data from a separate data source where the annotation is readily available or can be performed in a high-throughput fashion",
