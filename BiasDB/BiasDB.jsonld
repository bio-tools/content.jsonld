BiasDB currently contains 615 bias cases of signaling bias representing 481 individual ligands for 61 receptors. We provide information about the chemical structure, target receptor, type of bias, assay categories used for bias determination, reference ligand and literature source. BiasDB is a resource for medicinal chemists, pharmacologists and researchers interested in biased GPCR signaling",
