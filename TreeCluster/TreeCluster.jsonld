      "sc:description": "Clustering biological sequences using phylogenetic trees | Efficient phylogenetic clustering of viral sequences | TreeCluster is a tool that, given a tree T (Newick format) and a distance threshold t, finds the minimum number of clusters of the leaves of T such that some user-specified constraint is met in each cluster. The user can also specify a branch support threshold s such that no pair of leaves in any cluster can be connected by branches with support less than or equal to s. Note that all leaves given a cluster of -1 are singletons, meaning they did not cluster with any other leaves (i.e., each leaf with a cluster of -1 is in its own cluster)",
