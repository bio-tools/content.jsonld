      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Spectral characteristics of urine specimens from healthy human volunteers analyzed using Raman chemometric urinalysis (Rametrix) | Raman chemometric urinalysis (Rametrix™) was used to analyze 235 urine specimens from healthy individuals. The purpose of this study was to establish the \"range of normal\" for Raman spectra of urine specimens from healthy individuals. Ultimately, spectra falling outside of this range will be correlated with kidney and urinary tract disease. Rametrix™ analysis includes direct comparisons of Raman spectra but also principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) models, multivariate statistics, and it is available through GitHub as the Rametrix™ LITE Toolbox for MATLAB®. Results showed consistently overlapping Raman spectra of urine specimens with significantly larger variances in Raman shifts, found by PCA, corresponding to urea, creatinine, and glucose concentrations",
