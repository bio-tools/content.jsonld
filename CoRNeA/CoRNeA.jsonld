Since the composition and rate of evolution of the primary sequence are different between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, it is important to develop a method specifically for eukaryotic complexes. Here we report a new hybrid pipeline for the prediction of protein-protein interaction interfaces from the amino acid sequence information alone based on the framework of Co -evolution, machine learning ( R andom forest) and Ne twork A nalysis named CoRNeA trained specifically on eukaryotic protein complexes",
