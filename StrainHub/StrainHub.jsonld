      "sc:description": "A phylogenetic tool to construct pathogen transmission networks | Welcome to the StrainHub Repo - Files and Data - StrainHub Online: | Strainhub is designed as a web-based software to generate disease transmission networks and associated metrics from a combination of a phylogenetic tree and associated metadata. The software maps the metadata onto the tree and performs a parsimony ancestry reconstruction step to create links between the associated metadata and enable the construction of the network. Users also have the option to skip the StrainHub ancestry reconstruction step by generating a maximum clade credibility tree (MCC) through BEAST phylogeography | Generate disease transmission networks and associated metrics from a combination of a phylogenetic tree and associated metadata",
