      "sc:description": "The package facilitates primary analysis of ChIP-chip data. Its main functionalities are data read-in, quality assessment, data visualisation and identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip. It has functions to deal with two-color nucleotide microarrays from NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also contains more general functions for ChIP-chip data analysis, given that the data is supplied as RGList or ExpressionSet. It employs functions from various other packages.",
