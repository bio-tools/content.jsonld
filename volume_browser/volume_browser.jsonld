You can interact with with the image to view from any angle, or slice through it to see inside. You can also trace and label sections of the image. The PSC Volume Browser is a breathrough in 3D imaging because it allows you to view uncompressed datasets from a desktop computer that wouldnâ€™t have the capability view such data on its own.",
