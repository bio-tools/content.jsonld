      "sc:description": "DLocalMotif is a discriminitive motif discovery web service specifically designed to discover local motifs in protein sequences that are aligned relative to a defined sequence landmark. It uses three discriminitive scoring features, motif spatial confinement (MSC), motif over-representation (MOR) and motif relative entropy (MRE). These features establish if a motif is positioned in a constrained sequence interval in positive data set and absent in negative data set.",
