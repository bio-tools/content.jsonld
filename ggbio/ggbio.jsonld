The graphics are designed to answer common scientific questions, those often asked of high throughput genomics data. All core BioConductor appropriate data structures are supported. The package supports detailed views of genomic regions and genome-wide overviews. High-level plots include sequence fragment length, edge-linked interval to data view, mismatch pileup, and several splicing summaries.",
