Our major prediction modules based on the robust biomarkers such as 3-Gene HCC Biomarker, 4-Gene HCC Biomarker, 5-Gene HCC Biomarker. These HCC biomarkers identified using gene expression profiles of a total of 3,961 samples include 2,306 HCC and 1,655 non-tumorous samples. The datasets derived from various profiling platforms such as Affymatrix, Illumina, High-througput and Agilent. The user can also analyse the expression pattern of any of 26 \"core genes of HCC\" in cancerous vs normal conditions",
