We generated 35,000 different building blocks (fragments), which are not only relevant to their biosynthesis and degradation but also provide important information regarding side-effects and toxicity. It provides a variety of search options. Various analysis tools have been implemented including the calculation of amino acid preferences of fragments binding sites and classification of fragments.",
