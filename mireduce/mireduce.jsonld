  "sc:description": "This tool correlates the logarithm of expression fold changes of a set of genes with the motif content of the regulatory sequences of these genes. In particular, it correlates the genome wide mRNA log fold changes in experiments involving the knockout/knockdown/overexpression of one or more miRNAs with the motif content of the 3'UTRs. The model is based on linear regression, and is intended for genome-wide studies.",
