  "sc:description": "It is a visualisation tool developed to assist filtering on coverage and variant frequency for genomic variants from exome sequencing of parent-child trios. It organises the variant data by grouping each variant based on the laws of Mendelian inheritance. Taking three Variant Call Format files as input, the tool provides a user interface to test different coverage thresholds, to find the optimal threshold values, and to gain insights into the global effects of filtering.",
