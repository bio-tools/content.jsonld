      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'sRNAs', 'plant small RNAs' | - a database repository of uniformly-annotated small RNAs in plants | Abstract Small RNAs (sRNAs) are essential regulatory molecules, including three mayor classes in plants, microRNAs (miRNAs), phased small interfering RNAs (phased siRNAs or phasiRNAs), and heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs). Except miRNAs, the other two classes are not well-annotated and collected in public databases for most sequenced plant genomes. We performed comprehensive sRNA annotation for 138 plant species, which have fully sequenced genomes and public next-generation-sequencing (NGS) sRNA data available. The results are available via an online repository called sRNAanno ( www.plantsRNAs.org )",
