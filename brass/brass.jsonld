  "sc:description": "A MS Excel workbook for the analysis and display of rhythmic data series. Many in the circadian biology community use the FFT NLLS suite of programs, to estimate period and phase values from rhythmic experimental data. A user interface is developed to act as a front end to these programs. It imports data from most of the data acquisition packages commonly used in plant circadian research, and from a generic block of data. Then it runs FFT-NLLS on this data, and import the results into MS Excel.",
