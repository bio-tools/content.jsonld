If you use ScisTree, please cite: | The key feature of ScisTree is that it works with uncertain genotypes with individualized probability. That is, you can specify for each genotype (at a row/cell or column/site) different probabilities of being a particular genotype state. ScisTree allows both binary or ternary genotypes. Here is an example for binary genotypes. Note: don't include blank rows in the input genotype file",
