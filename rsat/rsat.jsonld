  "sc:description": "Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT) is a software suite combining specialised tools for the detection of regulatory signals in non-coding sequences. It includes tools for sequence retrieval, pattern discovery, pattern matching, genome-scale pattern matching, feature-map drawing, random sequence generation and other utilities. Tools may be accessed separately or connected to other tools. As well, the tools are available as web services for integration into programmatic work flows.",
