SNAPPy allows high-throughput HIV-1 subtyping locally while being resource efficient and scalable. This pipeline was constructed using Snakemake , and it uses MAFFT and for multiple sequence alignment, BLAST for similarirty querys, IQ-TREE for phylogenetic inference, and several Biopython modules for data parsing an analysis. For in-depth information on how the tool works please visit the documentation page.
