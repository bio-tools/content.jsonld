  "sc:description": "Collects a set of Java objects and algorithms for modeling observed dynamics by means of the Metabolic P (MP) theory, that is, a discrete mathematical theory based on P systems, introduced by Prof. Vincenzo Manca in 2004 for modeling biological dynamics. By means of the library, it is possible to model dynamical systems both at continuous and at discrete time. Moreover, the library comprises a set of regression algorithms for inferring MP models starting from time series of observations.",
