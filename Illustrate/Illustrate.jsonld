The method has been used as part of the \"Molecule of the Month,\" an ongoing educational column at the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http: rcsb.org). Insights from 20 years of application of the program are presented, and the program has been released both as open-source Fortran at GitHub and through an interactive web-based interface",
