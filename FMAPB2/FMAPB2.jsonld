      "sc:description": "Calculation of Second Virial Coefficients of Atomistic Proteins Using Fast Fourier Transform | Web Server for Calculating Protein Second Virial Coefficients | PI2PE: Protein Interface/Interior Prediction Engine | FMAPB2 implements FMAP, a method based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), to calculate second virial coefficients ( B 2 ) for proteins represented at the all-atom level in implicit solvent. FMAP stands for F FT-based M odeling of A tomistic P rotein-protein interactions. In FMAPB2, we express terms of the protein-protein inteaction energy as correlation functions, and evaluate them by FFT. These terms include steric repulsion, nonpolar attraction (in the form of a Lennard-Jones potential), and electrostatic interactions (in the form of a Debye-H&#252ckel potential)",
