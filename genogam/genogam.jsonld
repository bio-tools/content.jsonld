      "sc:description": "This package allows statistical analysis of genome-wide data with smooth functions using generalized additive models based on the implementation from the R-package 'mgcv'. It provides methods for the statistical analysis of ChIP-Seq data including inference of protein occupancy, and pointwise and region-wise differential analysis. Scaling of generalized additive model fitting to whole chromosomes is achieved by parallelization over overlapping genomic intervals.",
