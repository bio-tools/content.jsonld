We screened 84 miRNAs belonging to 21 conserved family from 4014 miRNAs in miRBase database which distributed in 47 plant species. Of the predicted 274 target genes,42 GO terms were found in the Gene Ontology. With the 135 numerical features which extracted by perl program, the difference significantly result of ANOVA (P<0.001) and multiple comparison show that the function labels Gâ€¦,GC content and Helix in biological process, cellular component and biological function, respectively",
