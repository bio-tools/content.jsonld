      "sc:description": "Provides functions for computing kaks for individual sites or specific amino acids and detecting correlated mutations among them. Three methods are provided for detecting correlated mutations, including conditional selection pressure, mutual information and Jaccard index. The computation consists of two steps: First, the positive selection sites are detected; Second, the mutation correlations are computed among the positive selection sites. Note that the first step is optional.",
