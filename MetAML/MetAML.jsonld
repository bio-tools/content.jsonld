The tool (i) is based on machine learning classifiers, (ii) includes automatic model and feature selection steps, (iii) comprises cross-validation and cross-study analysis, and (iv) uses as features quantitative microbiome profiles including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers.\nIt provides also species-level taxonomic profiles, marker presence data, and metadata for 3000+ public available metagenomes.",
