  "sc:description": "It is designed to find “direct repeats”, “inverted repeats”, “mirror repeats” and “complementary repeats”, from 3 bp to 64 bp length, in circular genomes. It processes input files directly extracted from GenBank database and several genomes can be input simultaneously. The program provides visualisation of the repeats location in the genomic structure and the search for specific motifs is also possible.",
