  "sc:description": "The first iterative method based on the pairwise comparison of profile Hidden Markov Models. In benchmarks it achieves better runtimes than other iterative sequence search methods such as PSI-BLAST or HMMER3 by using a fast prefilter based on profile-profile comparison. Furthermore, it greatly improves upon PSI-BLAST and HMMER3 in terms of sensitivity/selectivity and alignment quality.",
