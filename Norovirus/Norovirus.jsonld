We investigated the epidemiology of noroviruses in outpatient children from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, China. METHODS:Stool specimens were collected between January 2012 and December 2017 from 1433 children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis. All samples were analysed by conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for genogroup II NoVs amplifying both the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and partial capsid genes",
