Reverse ecology refers to the use of genomics to study ecology with no a priori assumptions about the organism(s) under consideration, linking organisms to their environment. It allows researchers to reconstruct the metabolic networks and study the ecology of poorly characterized microbial species from their genomic information, and has substantial potentials for microbial community ecological analysis.",
