Which is to appear inthe proceedings of ISMB/ECCB 2019 | The two main directories contain the necceasry code to produce the phylogeny figures (is_trees) and the random sequences figure (random_sequences). All of the figure generation is performed in a combination of perl and python. The omh_compute directory contains the code neccesary for the figure generation and is written in c++. This directory needs to be compiled before anything can be run in the other two",
