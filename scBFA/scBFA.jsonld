      "sc:description": "modeling detection patterns to mitigate technical noise in large-scale single-cell genomics data | A dimensionality reduction tool using gene detection pattern to mitigate noisy expression profile of scRNA-seq | This package is designed to model gene detection pattern of scRNA-seq through a binary factor analysis model. This model allows user to pass into a cell level covariate matrix X and gene level covariate matrix Q to account for nuisance variance(e.g batch effect), and it will output a low dimensional embedding matrix for downstream analysis | Binary Factor Analysis: a dimensionality reduction tool for noisy, high throughput single cell genomic data | Single cell Binary Factor Analysis (scBFA) and Binary PCA - These are tools for performing dimensionality reduction in large scRNA-seq datasets, as described in: Li, R., Quon, G. (2018) Gene detection models outperform gene expression for large-scale scRNA-seq analysis. bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/454629",
