Functions provided calculate distribution of susceptibilities, distribution of complexities with statistics, pathotype frequency distribution, as well as diversity indices for pathotypes. This package is meant to be a direct replacement for Herrmann, Löwer, Schachtel's (1999) <doi:10.1046/j.1365-3059.1999.00325.x> Habgood-Gilmour Spreadsheet, 'HaGiS', previously used for pathotype analysis | The goal of hagis is to provide analysis tools for plant pathogens with gene-for-gene interactions in the R programming language that the original Habgood-Gilmour Spreadsheet, HaGiS, (Herrmann, Löwer and Schachtel) provided",
