In order to make the results reproducible, we introduced function clusterSetRNGStream(), more deatails please see the Pacakge parallel | B, the number of And/Or trees in ATEN. This parameter always depends on the size/noise of the data. We suggest you set a higher B for large/noisy networks. If you set a very large B, although it won't affect the results much, but it takes much time..",
