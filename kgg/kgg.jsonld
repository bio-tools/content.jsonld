At present, it has three major functions, 1) prioritizing SNPs through a knowledge-based weighting method; 2) efficiently conducting powerful gene-based association tests using SNP p-values from GWAS; 3) advanced biological module-level analysis (pathway and PPI network enrichment) of significant genes suggested by the analyses of 1) or 2).",
