  "sc:description": "A general-purpose FAIRifier on the basis of the OpenRefine data cleaning and wrangling tool and the RDF plugin. This FAIRifier enables a post-hoc FAIRification workflow: load an existing dataset, perform data wrangling tasks, add FAIR attributes to the data, generate a linked data version of the data and, finally, push the result to an online FAIR data infrastructure to make it accessible and discoverable. Literal values in a dataset can be replaced by identifiers either manually or by embedded, customizable script expressions. The interoperability of the dataset can be improved by connecting these identifiers into a meaningful semantic graph-structure of ontological classes and properties using the integrated RDF model editor. A provenance trail automatically keeps track of each modification and additionally enables “undo” operations and repetition of operations on similar datasets. A FAIR data export function opens up a metadata editor to provide information about the dataset itself.",
