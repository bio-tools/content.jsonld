Thus, genes are annotated based on causal influences of pathway perturbations as opposed to pathway memberships alone. Identifying modulated pathways upstream of differentially expressed genes can facilitate the understanding of involved regulatory mechanisms. Currently only human genes and pathways are supported.",
