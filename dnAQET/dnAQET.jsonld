It generates a quality score for each contig based on the misassemblies observed in the alignments and the total alignment percentage of that contig | The de novo Assembly Quality Evaluation Tool (dnAQET) is a framework designed to evaluate a de novo assembly along with its scaffolds/contigs against a trusted reference genome. It first generates a quality score for each scaffold of an assembly based on its length, the misassemblies observed in the alignments and the total alignment percentage of a scaffold. Based on the quality scores assigned to the contigs/scaffolds, it computes an overall quality score for the whole assembly | An official website of the United States government | U S",
