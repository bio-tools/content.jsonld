      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | a New Age Peptide Search Engine for Comprehensive MS/MS Sequencing Through Vast Protein Databases in Minutes | Recent increases in mass spectrometry speed, sensitivity, and resolution now permit comprehensive proteomics coverage. However, the results are often hindered by sub-optimal data processing pipelines. In almost all MS MS peptide search engines, users must limit their search space to a canonical database due to time constraints and q value considerations, but this typically does not reflect the individual genetic variations of the organism being studied. In addition, engines will nearly always assume the presence of only fully tryptic peptides and limit PTMs to a handful. Even on high-performance servers, these search engines are computationally expensive, and most users decide to dial back their search parameters",
