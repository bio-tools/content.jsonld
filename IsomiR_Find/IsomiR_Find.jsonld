Importantly, when SNPs are located in pre-miRNAs, they affect their splicing mechanism and change the function of miRNAs. To improve disease risk assessment, we propose an approach and developed a software tool, IsomiR_Find, to identify disease phenotype-related SNPs and isomiRs in individuals. Our approach is based on the individual's samples, with SNP information extracted from the 1000 Genomes Project. SNPs were mapped to pre-miRNAs based on whole-genome coordinates and then SNP-pre-miRNA sequences were constructed. Moreover, we developed matpred2, a software tool to identify the four splicing sites of mature miRNAs",
