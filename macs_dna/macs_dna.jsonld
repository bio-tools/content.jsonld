  "sc:description": "It is a simulator of the coalescent process that simulates geneologies spatially across chromosomes as a Markovian process. The algorithm scales linearly in time with respect to sample size and sequence length. However, it more accurately models the true coalescent, while supporting all demographic scenarios found in the popular program MS making this program appropriate for simulating data for structured populations in genome wide association studies.",
