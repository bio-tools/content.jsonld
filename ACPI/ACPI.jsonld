      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'parcels', 'parcellating', 'brain-behaviour', 'widely-accepted' | Optimising network modelling methods for fMRI | Abstract A major goal of neuroimaging studies is to develop predictive models to analyse the relationship between whole brain functional connectivity patterns and behavioural traits. However, there is no single widely-accepted standard pipeline for analyzing functional connectivity. The common procedure for designing functional connectivity based predictive models entails three main steps: parcellating the brain, estimating the interaction between defined parcels, and lastly, using these integrated associations between brain parcels as features fed to a classifier for predicting non-imaging variables e.g., behavioural traits, demographics, emotional measures, etc",
