      "sc:description": "VarGenius is a platform for analysis of variants from DNA sequencing data. Currently it can be used for WES and Panels. Starting from fastq files it can execute the GATK Best Practices pipeline doing both single calling and joint calling. Then it executes Annovar for variant annotation and generates a readable output in tabular and XLS format. All the data extracted from the samples (variants, genotypes, etc..) are uploaded into a Postgres database which can be used for further downstream analyses.",
