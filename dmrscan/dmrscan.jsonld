  "sc:description": "It detects differentially methylated regions, using a scan statistic with underlying Poisson heuristics. The scan statistic will depend on a sequence of window sizes and on a threshold for each window size. This threshold can be calculated by three different means: i) analytically using Siegmund solution, ii) an important sampling as suggested by Zhang, and a iii) full MCMC modeling of the data, choosing between a number of different options for modeling the dependency between each CpG.",
