Cyclodextrin polymers have been investigated for drug delivery specifically due to their capacity to exploit this affinity interaction to change the rate of drug release. Testing drug candidates; however, for affinity is time-consuming, making computational predictions more effective. One option, molecular \"docking\" programs, provide predictions of affinity, but lack reliability, as their accuracy with cyclodextrin remains unverified experimentally",
