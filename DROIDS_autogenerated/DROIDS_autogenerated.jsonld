DIFFERENT) bio.tools/droids | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MD', 'maxDemon' | Machine learning based detection of genetic and drug class variant impact on functionally conserved protein binding dynamics | DROIDS-3.0-comparative-protein-dynamics | The Babbitt Lab at RIT has developed DROIDS 3.0 + maxDemon 1.0, a software package for comparative protein dynamics and measure of genetic and drug class impacts on functional dynamics. Vist our website for more details.. | a GUI based script PATHS.pl will prompt paths to working directories for UCSF Chimera, Amber forcefields, and Amber Home directory and write a .ctl file. Then the main DROIDS menu will pop up. Requires Amber 16/18 license and some dependencies in R, python and perl (see user doc with download)",
