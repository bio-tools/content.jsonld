It provides better services than fog-cloud computing with better performance in reasonably low cost way and allows users to eliminate numerous limitations inherent in fog-cloud computing, although it inherits those security-privacy issues from fog-cloud computing. A novel privacy-preserving mutual authentication in TMIS for mobile Edge-Cloud architecture (abbreviated to NPMA) is constructed in this paper. NPMA scheme not only mitigates some weaknesses of fog-cloud computing, but has other advantages",
