It enables the assessment of multiple non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in a single protein by visualizing the mutated residues within the wild type structure, collecting available pathogenicity information from different databases, predicting binding pockets, protein stability changes and pathogenicity, as well as performing a cluster analysis on comprised amino acid substitutions.",
