      "sc:description": "> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RESULTS:ChIPseqSpikeInFree' | A ChIP-seq normalization approach to reveal global changes in histone modifications without spike-in | A Spike-in Free ChIP-Seq Normalization Approach for Detecting Global Changes in Histone Modifications | We develop ChIPseqSpikeInFree, a novel ChIP-seq normalization method to effectively determine scaling factors for samples across various conditions and treatments, which does not rely on exogenous spike-in chromatin or peak detection to reveal global changes in histone modification occupancy. This method is capable of revealing the similar magnitude of global changes as the spike-in method | Traditional reads per million (RPM) normalization method is inappropriate for the evaluation of ChIP-seq data when the treatment or mutation has the global effect",
