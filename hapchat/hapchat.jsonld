      "sc:description": "This method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, this method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.",
