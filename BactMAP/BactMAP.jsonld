      "sc:description": "an R package for integrating, analyzing and visualizing bacterial microscopy data | Abstract High-throughput analyses of single-cell microscopy data is a critical tool within the field of bacterial cell biology. Several programs have been developed to specifically segment bacterial cells from phase-contrast images. Together with spot and object detection algorithms, these programs offer powerful approaches to quantify observations from microscopy data, ranging from cell-to-cell genealogy to localization and movement of proteins. Most segmentation programs contain specific post-processing and plotting options, but these options vary between programs and possibilities to optimize or alter the outputs are often limited. Therefore, we developed BactMAP ( Bac terial t oolbox for M icroscopy A nalysis & P lotting), a software package that allows researchers to transform cell segmentation and spot detection data generated by different programs automatically into various plots",
