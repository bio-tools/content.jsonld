From the time-series data of gene expression, the software identifies not only gene regulatory interactions but also the temporal aspects of the regulatory interactions using two types of scores, R1 and R2. As for the temporal aspect of gene regulatory relations, it identifies the order of the gene regulatory relations and the pace of the relations.",
