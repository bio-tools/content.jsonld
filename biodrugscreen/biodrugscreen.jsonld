  "sc:description": "Resource for ranking molecules docked against a large number of targets in the human proteome. Nearly 1600 molecules from the freely available NCI diversity set were docked onto 1926 cavities identified on 1589 human targets resulting in >3 million receptor-ligand complexes. The targets are originated from Human Cancer Protein Interaction Network, which we have updated, as well as the Human Druggable Proteome, created for this. This makes the resource highly valuable in drug discovery.",
