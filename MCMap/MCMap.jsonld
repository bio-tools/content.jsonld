      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'bisb' | Computational Tool for Mapping Energy Landscapes of Transient Protein-Protein Interactions | MCMap is a tool particularly well-suited for analyzing energy landscapes of transient macromolecular complexes. The program applies a Monte Carlo strategy, where the ligand moves randomly in the electrostatic field of the receptor. By applying importance sampling, the major interaction sites are mapped, resulting in a global distribution of ligand-receptor complexes. This approach displays the dynamic character of transiently interacting protein complexes where not a single complex but an ensemble of complexes better describes the protein interactions. The software provides a broad range of analysis options which allow for relating the simulations to experimental data and for interpreting them on a structural level",
