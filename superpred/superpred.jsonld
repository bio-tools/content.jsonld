  "sc:description": "The SuperPred web server compares the structural fingerprint of an input molecule to a database of drugs connected to their drug targets and affected pathways. As the biological effect is well predictable, if the structural similarity is sufficient, the web-server allows prognoses about the medical indication area of novel compounds and to find new leads for known targets. Such information can be useful in drug classification and target prediction.",
