      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'VG', 'gbwt', 'variation graphs', 'variation graph' | Haplotype-aware graph indexes | This is a reimplementation of the Generalized Compressed Suffix Array (GCSA), a BWT-based index for directed graphs | The old implementation indexed all paths in a directed acyclic graph, which had to be determinized before index construction. GCSA2 approximates the graph with a de Bruijn graph (with k = 256 or less), allowing it to index more complex graphs as well as graphs containing cycles. The order of the de Bruijn graph limits the length of the queries the index is able to answer correctly. Longer queries may result in false positives (but no false negatives)",
