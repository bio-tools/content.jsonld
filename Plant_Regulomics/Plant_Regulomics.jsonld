      "sc:description": "a data-driven interface for retrieving upstream regulators from plant multi-omics data | Plant Regulomics is a data-driven interface for retrieving upstream regulators from plant multi-omics data, which integrates 20,737 transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets and diverse sources of functional evidence (58,112 functional terms and 695,414 protein-protein interactions) from six plant species, namely Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Glycine max, Solanum lycopersicum and Triticum aestivum, along with the orthologous genes from 56 whole-genome sequenced plant species. These data were well-organized to gene modules and further implemented into the same statistical framework",
