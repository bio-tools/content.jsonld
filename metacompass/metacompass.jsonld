  "sc:description": "MetaCompass is a software package for comparative assembly of metagenomic reads. MetaCompass achieves comparable assembly performance to the state of the art de novo assemblers, but these two different approaches complement each other a lot. So combining contigs between MetaCompass and other independent de novo assemblers give us the best overall metagenomic assembly.",
