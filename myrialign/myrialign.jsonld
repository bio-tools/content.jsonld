  "sc:description": "Software to align short reads produced by a short read genome sequencer to a reference genome. It performs brute force alignment using a variant on the \"bitap\" algorithm that aligns several thousand reads to a reference in parallel. It uses bit-parallelism, multiple processors, and Cell SPUs if available.\nIt will find alignments with any number of errors up to a user specified cutoff. The emphasis is on doing a 100% accurate search as fast as is possible.",
