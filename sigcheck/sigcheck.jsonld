Based on suggestions in that paper, this tool accepts a data set (as an ExpressionSet) and a gene signature, and compares its performance on survival and/or classification tasks against a) random gene signatures of the same length; b) known, related and unrelated gene signatures; and c) permuted data and/or metadata.",
