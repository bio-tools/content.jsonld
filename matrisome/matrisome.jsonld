Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model organism to study fundamental mechanisms underlying ECM protein secretion, ECM assembly, and ECM roles in pathophysiological processes. However, as of today, we do not possess a well-defined list of the components forming the ECM of this organism. We previously reported the development of computational pipelines to define the matrisome - the ensemble of genes encoding ECM and ECM-associated proteins - of humans, mice, zebrafish and C. elegans. Using a similar approach, we report here that the Drosophila matrisome is composed of 641 genes",
