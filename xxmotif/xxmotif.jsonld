It uses a new approach for finding enriched motifs: It directly optimizes the statistical significance of enrichment for PWMs. It can also score conservation and positional clustering of motifs. In several benchmarks on yeast and metazoan sequences, the underlying XXmotif method showed better sensitivity and produced PWMs of higher quality than state-of-the-art tools.",
