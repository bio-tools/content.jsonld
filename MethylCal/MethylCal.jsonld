      "sc:description": "Bayesian calibration of methylation levels | This package allows the calibration of methylation levels using MethylCal, a Bayesian calibration tool based on INLA (Rue et al., 2009). The package permits the visualisation of the calibration curve derived from standard controls with known methylation percentages for a selected assay. It also allows the correction of the methylation levels in case and control samples. If cases are provided, MethylCal performs a differential methylation test to detect hyper- and hypo-methylated samples. Besides MethylCal method, the package also includes the calibration and the correction provided by two alternative methods (Warnecke et al., 1997; Moskalev et al., 2011)",
