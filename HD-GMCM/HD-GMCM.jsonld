      "sc:description": "Gaussian Mixture Copulas for High-Dimensional Clustering and Dependency-based Subtyping | MOTIVATION:The identification of sub-populations of patients with similar characteristics, called patient subtyping, is important for realizing the goals of Precision Medicine. Accurate subtyping is crucial for tailoring therapeutic strategies that can potentially lead to reduced mortality and morbidity. Model-based clustering, such as Gaussian mixture models, provides a principled and interpretable methodology that is widely used to identify subtypes. However, they impose identical marginal distributions on each variable; such assumptions restrict their modeling flexibility and deteriorates clustering performance. RESULTS:In this paper, we use the statistical framework of copulas to decouple the modeling of marginals from the dependencies between them. Current copula-based methods cannot scale to high dimensions due to challenges in parameter inference",
