Flow cytometry is the preferred method for the immunophenotypic characterization of leukemia and lymphoma, being able to process and register multiparametric data about tens of thousands of cells per second. METHODS:The proposed decision-tree is composed by logistic function nodes that branch throughout the tree into sets of (possible) distinct leukemia lymphoma diagnoses. To avoid overfitting, regularization via the Lasso algorithm was used",
