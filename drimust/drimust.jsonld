      "sc:description": "DRIMUST is a software implementation of a new statistical and algorithmic approach that we developed to enable efficient motif searches, covering a broader range of motif spaces comparing with state of the art motif searching tools. In particular, DRIMUST can efficiently search for variable gapped motifs, long motifs and motifs over large alphabets. The motif structure that DRIMUST searches comprises two half sites separated by a gap, that can be of a variable length.",
