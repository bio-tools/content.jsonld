      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A fast and automatic lung and trachea CT-image segmentation method | PURPOSE:The automated segmentation of each lung and trachea in CT scans is commonly taken as a solved problem. Indeed, existing approaches may easily fail in the presence of some abnormalities caused by a disease, trauma, or previous surgery. For robustness, we present ALTIS (implementation is available at http: lids.ic.unicamp.br downloads) - a fast automatic lung and trachea CT-image segmentation method that relies on image features and relative shape- and intensity-based characteristics less affected by most appearance variations of abnormal lungs and trachea. METHODS:ALTIS consists of a sequence of image foresting transforms (IFTs) organized in three main steps: (a) lung-and-trachea extraction, (b) seed estimation inside background, trachea, left lung, and right lung, and (c) their delineation such that each object is defined by an optimum-path forest rooted at its internal seeds",
