      "sc:description": "Energy based, for narrowing down the search space of tertiary structures of small globular proteins. The protocol comprises 8 different computational modules that form an automated pipeline. It combines physics based potentials with biophysical filters to arrive at 10 plausible candidate structures starting from sequence and secondary structure information. The methodology has been validated here on 50 small globular proteins consisting of helices and strands with known tertiary structures.",
