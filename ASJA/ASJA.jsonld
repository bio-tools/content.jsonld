      "sc:description": "A Program for Assembling Splice Junctions Analysis | RNA splicing may generate different kinds of splice junctions, such as linear, back-splice and fusion junctions. Only a limited number of programs are available for detection and quantification of splice junctions. Here, we present Assembling Splice Junctions Analysis (ASJA), a software package that identifies and characterizes all splice junctions from high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. ASJA processes assembled transcripts and chimeric alignments from the STAR aligner and S tringTie assembler. ASJA provides the unique position and normalized expression level of each junction. Annotations and integrative analysis of the junctions enable additional filtering. It is also appropriate for the identification of novel junctions. Implementation and Dependencies",
