It combines isotonic regression on a partially ordered set with CBNs for estimating order constraints among events. The model has been developed to jointly estimate mutational order constraints among genetic events and a genotype-phenotype mapping (such as a fitness landscape) that is non-decreasing along the lattice of genotypes.",
