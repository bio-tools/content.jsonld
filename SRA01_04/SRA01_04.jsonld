      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SRA01', 'LEC SRA01', 'LEC SRA01 04', 'LEC' | Molecular characterization of the human lens epithelium-derived cell line SRA01/04 | Cataract-associated gene discovery in human and animal models have informed on key aspects of human lens development, homeostasis and pathology. Additionally, in vitro models such as the culture of permanent human lens epithelium-derived cell lines (LECs) have also been utilized to understand the molecular biology of lens cells. However, these resources remain uncharacterized, specifically regarding their global gene expression and suitability to model lens cell biology. Therefore, we sought to molecularly characterize gene expression in the human LEC, SRA01 04, which is commonly used in lens studies. We first performed short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and validated SRA01 04 LEC for its human origin, as recommended by the eye research community",
