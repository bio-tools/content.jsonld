      "sc:description": "An Efficient De Novo Peptide Sequencing Tool for Large-scale MS/MS Spectra Analysis | Introductionï¼š As the number of the MS/MS spectra increases rapidly, the excessive computation time taken by MS/MS spectra data analysis has become a critical concern in computational biology. In this work, we designed and implemented SWPepNovo, an efficient de novo peptide sequencing tool for large-scale MS/MS spectra data analysis using a novel peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) algorithm. To achieve the high performance, we designed an improved scoring algorithm to reduce the time complexity and eliminate the data dependence to enable all possible locality and vectorizations. Performance is also tuned by pre-fetching, double buffering mechanism, and an optimized memory access scheme, to achieve an optimum performance and best utilization of various computing resources within neo-heterogeneous many-core architecture",
