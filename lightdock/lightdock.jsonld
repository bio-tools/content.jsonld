  "sc:description": "It is a protein-protein docking framework based on the Glowworm Swarm Optimization algorithm.\nThe framework is highly versatile, with many options that can be further developed and optimized by the users: it can accept any user-defined scoring function, can use local gradient-free minimization, the simulation can be restrained from the beginning to focus on user-assigned interacting regions, and it has support for the use of pre-calculated conformers for both receptor and ligand.",
