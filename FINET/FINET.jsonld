      "sc:description": "FINET is a software to infer any network (1). Implemented by Julia with algorithms of stability selection and elastic-net, plus parameter optimization, finet can infer a network fast and accurately from a big data. Additionally, finet is user-friendly, only one single command line to complete all computational processes. Developed under Linux, but finet should work in any OS system. Installing and using finet becomes simple by using following instructions",
