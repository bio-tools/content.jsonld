      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | High-Fidelity Product Simulation in a Virtual-Physical Environment | In the development of a new product, the design team must describe the expected effects of the final products to potential users and stakeholders. However, existing prototyping tools can only present a product imperfectly, due to limitations at different levels. Specifically, the physical product model, which may be the product of 3D printing, could lack a visual interface; the presentation of the product through modeling software such as Rhinoceros 3D does not provide good realistic tactile perception; or the interface platforms, such as Axure RP, used to display the interactive effects differ from those to be used in the actual operation. Thus, we present the VPModel, a high-fidelity prototyping tool, able to integrate multiple prototyping methods simultaneously",
