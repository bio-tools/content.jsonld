DIFFERENT) bio.tools/adherer | An Open Science Approach to Estimating Adherence to Medications Using Electronic Healthcare Databases | Adherence to medications is a key performance indicator and behavioral outcome in healthcare. Electronic healthcare databases represent rich data sources for estimating adherence in both research and practice. To build a solid evidence base for adherence management across clinical settings, it is necessary to standardize adherence estimation and facilitate its appropriate use. We present the recent development and oportunities offered by AdhereR, an R package for visualisation of medication histories and computation of adherence",
