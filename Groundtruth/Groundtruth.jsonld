      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Matlab GUI for Artifact and Feature Identification in Physiological Signals | Groundtruth is a Matlab Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed for the identification of key features and artifacts within physiological signals. The ultimate aim of this GUI is to provide a simple means of assessing the performance of new sensors. Secondary, to this is providing a means of providing marked data, enabling assessment of automated artifact rejection and feature identification algorithms. With the emergence of new wearable sensor technologies, there is an unmet need for convenient assessment of device performance, and a faster means of assessing new algorithms. The proposed GUI allows interactive marking of artifact regions as well as simultaneous interactive identification of key features, e.g., respiration peaks in respiration signals, R-peaks in Electrocardiography signals, etc",
