However, considering the inherent time-consuming and expensive of traditional in vitro experiments, more and more attention has been paid to the development of efficient and feasible computational methods to predict the potential associations between miRNA and disease. METHODS:In this work, we present a machine learning-based model called MLMDA for predicting the association of miRNAs and diseases. More specifically, we first use the k-mer sparse matrix to extract miRNA sequence information, and combine it with miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity information",
