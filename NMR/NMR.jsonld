      "sc:description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Systems NMR' | single-sample quantification of RNA, proteins and metabolites for biomolecular network analysis | In Vitro Transcription NMR. Protocol, code and examples for the co-transcriptional RNA folding network reconstruction | The protocol describes how to setup and analyse observation of a co-transcriptional RNA folding network by Systems NMR approach. While most experimental approaches can monitor only a single molecule class or reaction type at a time, Systems NMR permits single-sample dynamic quantification of entire “heterotypic” networks – involving different reaction and molecule types. It thus provides a deeper systems-level understanding of biological network dynamics by combining the dynamic resolution of biochemical assays and the multiplexing ability of “omics”",
