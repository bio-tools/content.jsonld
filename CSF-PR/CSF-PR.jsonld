      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | Essential Features and Use Cases of the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Resource (CSF-PR) | Every year, a large number of published studies present biomarkers for various neurological disorders. Many of these studies are based on mass spectrometry proteomics data and describe comparison of the abundance of proteins in cerebrospinal fluid between two or more disease groups. As the number of such studies is growing, it is no longer straightforward to obtain an overview of which specific proteins are increased or decreased between the numerous relevant diseases and their many subcategories, or to see the larger picture or trends between related diseases",
