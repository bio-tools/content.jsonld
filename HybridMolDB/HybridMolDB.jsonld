      "sc:description": "A Manually Curated Database Dedicated to Hybrid Molecules for Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery | Hybrid Molecules is defined as the design of new chemical molecule that hybridizes two or more pharmacophoric moieties from known identical or non-identical bioactive molecules, or two or more known identical or non-identical bioactive molecules directly into a single molecule to obtain better affinity and efficacy or to improve the properties of the parent molecules or to interact with two or multiple targets or to reduce undesirable side effects or to decrease in drug-drug interactions or reduce emergence of drug resistance | Hybrid Molecule Database (HybridMolDB) provides a versatile resource for the display, search, and analysis of the structure, manual-annotated design protocol, the pharmacological data, some physicochemical and ligand efficiency and druglike and ADMET characteristics and the proÔ¨Åle of targets of the well-known hybrid molecules",
