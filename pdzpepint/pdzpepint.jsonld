      "sc:description": "It is a cluster based prediction tool to predict binding peptides of PDZ domains in human, mouse, fly and worm. Peptides are represented as 5 C-terminal sequences of binding proteins. Depending on the user requirement Gene Ontology database can be used for getting reliable interactions. Additionally, it will also consider the C-terminal peptides that are intrinsically unstructured for getting high confidence interactions.",
