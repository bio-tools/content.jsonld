  "sc:description": "It is a comprehensive portable software package for analysis and visualization of microarray data. It gives access to methods for unsupervised analysis, supervised analysis and visualisation in an integrated and flexible way. Its efficiency allows interactive clustering of thousands of expression profiles on standard personal computers. Supervised analysis can be performed on samples by simple sample annotation or on genes through tools for metabolic pathway analysis and Gene Ontology mapping.",
