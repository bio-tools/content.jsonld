  "sc:description": "Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) detects copy number variation from the distribution of copy number ratios. From the data, it will fit one component for each of the following copy number states: deletion, copy-neutral, 1 and 2 additional copy; with a constraint on the difference between the mixture means. Then for a given individual, it will determine the probabilities for each copy number state and compute the expected copy number (dosage).",
