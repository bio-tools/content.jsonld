To achieve this goal, synthetic simulated subjects are obtained by permutations of gene labels. Then, each synthetic subject is tested against the corresponding subtype classifier to build the null distribution. Thus, classification confidence measurement can be provided for each subject, to assist physician therapy choice.",
