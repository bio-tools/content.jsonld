We recently developed new methods to identify parent-of-origin (PoO) interactions with environmental exposures (PoOxE) and applied them to families with children born with isolated cleft palate only. Here, we used the same genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset and methodology to screen for PoOxE effects in the larger sample of CL P triads",
