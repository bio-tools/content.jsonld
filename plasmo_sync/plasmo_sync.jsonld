Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability can be an important determinant of cellular adaptation, stress tolerance and immune evasion in the host. To investigate cellular heterogeneity, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 4949 and 6873 synchronized Plasmodium cells in control and under temperature stress condition (phenocopying the cyclic bouts of fever experienced during malarial infection). High-resolution clustering of scRNA-seq datasets and a combination of gene signatures allow identification of cellular heterogeneity and stage transition during stress adaptation",
