      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Fracture liaison service and mortality in elderly hip fracture patients | Osteoporosis is a metabolic disorder that results in increased bone fragility and risk of fractures. Hip fracture is the most important fragility fracture. Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) is a secondary prevention model which identifies patients at risk for fragility fractures. The introduction of an intensive FLS model could decrease 1-year-mortality of hip fracture patients. INTRODUCTION:Hip fractures are a clinical manifestation of osteoporosis, and these patients are at risk of premature death and suffering subsequent fractures. FLS is an approach for secondary facture prevention by identifying patients with fragility fractures and initiating the appropriate treatment. Our objective is to analyze the effect of the FLS model over the first-year mortality rates following a hip fracture",
