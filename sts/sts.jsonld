The indexes are suffix trees, and can be constructed for single or multiple DNA sequences in very flexible ways. The input format is fasta. The output is in the form of tabular results, generally showing longest common substring (LCS) matches among the input sequences. You can also search for exact and inexact occurrences of user specified strings.",
