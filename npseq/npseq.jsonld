The only difference is that our tool uses symmetric cutoffs, while SAM uses asymmetric cutoffs. Therefore, for some datasets, all significant genes obtained by SAM are either all up-regulated or all down-regulated, but npSeq almost always gives significant genes that include both up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes.",
