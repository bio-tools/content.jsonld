Pinpointing pathogens in metagenomics classification results is often complicated by host and laboratory contaminants as well as many non-pathogenic microbiota. Researchers can analyze, display and transform results from the Kraken and Centrifuge classifiers using interactive tables, heatmaps and flow diagrams.",
