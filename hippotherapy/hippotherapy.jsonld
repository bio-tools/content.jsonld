      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'hippotherapy Proponents hippotherapy' | a systematic mapping review of peer-reviewed research, 1980 to 2018 | Purpose: Comprehensively and systematically map peer-reviewed studies of hippotherapy published over 30 years, from 1980 through 2018, from the perspective of a phased scientific approach to developing complex interventions as a guide to future research and practice. Methods: A systematic mapping review of research of hippotherapy was conducted. Searches of nine databases produced 3,528 unique records; 78 full-text, English-written studies were reviewed, the earliest of which was published in 1998. Data relevant to study aims were extracted electronically from these studies and analyzed using queries and pivot tables. Results: Children with cerebral palsy and physical therapists were most prevalent as participants and providers. Equine movement was hippotherapy's core component and mechanism",
