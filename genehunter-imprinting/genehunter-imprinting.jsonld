      "sc:description": "It is a modification of the GENEHUNTER software package . It allows for a parametric multi-marker linkage analysis of dichotomous traits caused by imprinted genes. By specification of two heterozygote penetrance parameters, paternal and maternal origin of the disease allele can be treated differently in terms of probability of expression of the trait. Therefore, a disease model which accounts for imprinting includes four penetrances instead of only three.",
