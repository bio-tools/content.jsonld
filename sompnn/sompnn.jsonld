  "sc:description": "A novel model for prediction of TMH that features by minimal parameter assumptions requirement and high computational efficiency. In this model, a self-organizing map (SOM) is used to adaptively learn the helices distribution knowledge hidden in the training data, and then a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is adopted to predict TMH segments based on the knowledge learned by SOM.",
