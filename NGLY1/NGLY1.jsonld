The user can navigate the knowledge in the graph in the Neo4j Browser website. This knowledge graph is a structured review around the research question what is the mechanism underpinning the NGLY1-AQP1 regulation association and explaining the reduced transcriptomic expression of multiple Aquaporins in NGLY1 deficient cells?. The graph v3.2 is the first deployed in the Wikibase application for community contribution and curation",
