The Infinium MethylationEPIC array has replaced the Infinium Methylation450K array. The two arrays use the same technology, with the EPIC array assaying 865859 CpG sites, almost double the number of sites present on the 450K array. In this study, we compare DNA methylation values of shared CpGs of the same human cartilage samples assayed using both platforms. Methods DNA methylation was measured in 21 human cartilage samples using the Illumina Infinium Methylation450K BeadChip and the Infinium methylationEPIC array",
