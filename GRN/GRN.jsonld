      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | Perturbation-based gene regulatory network inference to unravel oncogenic mechanisms | Abstract The gene regulatory network (GRN) of human cells encodes mechanisms to ensure proper functioning. However, if this GRN is dysregulated, the cell may enter into a disease state such as cancer. Understanding the GRN as a system can therefore help identify novel mechanisms underlying disease, which can lead to new therapies. Reliable inference of GRNs is however still a major challenge in systems biology. To deduce regulatory interactions relevant to cancer, we applied a recent computational inference framework to data from perturbation experiments in squamous carcinoma cell line A431. GRNs were inferred using several methods, and the false discovery rate was controlled by the NestBoot framework. We developed a novel approach to assess the predictiveness of inferred GRNs against validation data, despite the lack of a gold standard",
