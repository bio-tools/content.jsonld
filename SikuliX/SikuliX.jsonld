For what is it? Get it? Use it? Get help? Contribute? | Latest stable version: 2.0.0 —— Nightly builds: 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT | Both left the project at Sikuli-X-1.0rc3 during 2012, when I decided to take over development and support and name it SikuliX | SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on",
