  "sc:description": "Highly sensitive and specific tool in the detection of splices as well as CPU and memory efficiency. It can be applied to both short (<75 bp) and long reads (>=75 bp) and it is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. The tool leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy.",
