      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A mobile 3D application to improve the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of clinician-led home-based falls-risk assessments | BACKGROUND:A key falls prevention intervention delivered within occupational therapy is the home environment falls-risk assessment process. This involves the clinician visiting the patient's home and using a 2D paper-based measurement guidance booklet to ensure that all measurements are taken and recorded accurately. However, 30% of all assistive devices installed within the home are abandoned by patients, in part as a result of the inaccurate measurements being recorded as part of the home environment falls-risk assessment process. In the absence of more appropriate and effective guidance, high levels of device abandonment are likely to persist",
