      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Open Source Infrastructure for Health Care Data Integration and Machine Learning Analyses | PURPOSE:We have created a cloud-based machine learning system (CLOBNET) that is an open-source, lean infrastructure for electronic health record (EHR) data integration and is capable of extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing. CLOBNET enables comprehensive analysis and visualization of structured EHR data. We demonstrate the utility of CLOBNET by predicting primary therapy outcomes of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) on the basis of EHR data. MATERIALS AND METHODS:CLOBNET is built using open-source software to make data preprocessing, analysis, and model training user friendly. The source code of CLOBNET is available in GitHub",
