Columns are tab-separated, first line is a header which is ignored by HypercubeME. First column (example: '0C:2T') is a column-separated mutation list of a particular mutant variant. Each mutation consists of mutated position and the variant (amino acid residue or RNA/DNA base) where it is mutated. For wild-type HypercubeME uses '0Z', where 'Z' means wild-type variant (amino acid residue or RNA/DNA base); however, in the genotype file wild-type can also be denoted as empty string as in the file 'test_complete_03.txt'. All other columns are ignored by HypercubeME",
