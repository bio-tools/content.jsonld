  "sc:description": "It is  a new work-flow designed for a comprehensive analysis of circRNAs composed of: the circRNAs prediction, their classification and annotation using public databases, the back-splicing sequence reconstruction, the internal alternative structure definition, the alignment-free circRNAs quantification from RNA-Seq reads, and their differential expression analysis.\nDocker4Circ was specifically designed for making easier and more accessible circRNA analysis thanks to its containerization and an available user-friendly Java GUI Interface. Furthermore, Docker4Circ ensures a reproducible analysis because all its tasks were embedded into an docker image following guideline provided by Reproducible\nBioinformatics Project (RBP, http://reproducible-bioinformatics.org/).",
