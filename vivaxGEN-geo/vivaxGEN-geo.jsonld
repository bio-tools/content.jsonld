Traditionally, patient travel history has been used to identify imported cases, but the long-latency liver stages confound this approach in Plasmodium vivax. Molecular tools to identify and map imported cases offer a more robust approach, that can be combined with drug resistance and other surveillance markers in high-throughput, population-based genotyping frameworks. Using a machine learning approach incorporating hierarchical FST (HFST) and decision tree (DT) analysis applied to 831 P. vivax genomes from 20 countries, we identified a 28-Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) barcode with high capacity to predict the country of origin",
