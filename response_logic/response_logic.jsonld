This is the Python package. Various response logic projects can be found in a dedicated repository | This repository holds various projects that make use of the response-logic approach to infer networks from perturbation response data. To run the scripts you need to install the response-logic python package. Once installed, simply download this repository and run the scripts with Python 3 as documented in a dedicated README found in each project subfolder. Particularly look into the toy_model project to learn how to use the response-logic package",
