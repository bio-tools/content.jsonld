Automatically runs several analysis and integrates the results to select the appropriate consensus exon-intron structures and to predict open reading frames (ORFs) at each locus. Functional annotation and a functional domain search, are also performed for the predicted ORFs. The resultant annotation information is visualized with GBrowse and the results can be downloaded in Microsoft Excel format.",
