  "sc:description": "The Diversity GIS Editor (DWB-DGE) is a stand-alone application of Diversity Workbench (DWB). It might be installed as an independent module of a DWB environment. Beside this, the DGE is an integrated part of DiversityCollection, DiversityGazetteers and DiversitySamplingPlots. The DGE allows for creating, visualizing, editing and storing samples within a geographical environment. In combination with a background map with world coordinates, collections of Microsoft SQL Geometry Objects (points, lines, areas) may be displayed and edited. The screen and world coordinates of the objects are calculated. Color, thickness and transparency of the elements can be designed. The working area may be shifted or zoomed. The background map could either be loaded from a storage device or created with an online map server tool. Maps without world coordinates may be adjusted to a background map with coordinates by setting reference points. This function allows the georeferencing of historical maps.",
