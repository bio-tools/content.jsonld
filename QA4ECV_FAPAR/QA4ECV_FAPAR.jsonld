The project developed and applied a Quality Assurance framework on new and improved multi-decadal data records of the Land ECVs Albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), and of the Atmosphere ECVs nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO) | We encourage you to browse through the website and survey the scope of QA4ECV activities",
