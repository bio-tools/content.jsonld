      "sc:description": "Towards gene regulatory network predictions of high-certainty | Abstract Motivation Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks has for years struggled with high correlation in expression between regulatory elements. If two regulators have matching expression patterns it is impossible to differentiate between the two, and thus false positive identifications are abundant. Results To allow for gene regulation predictions of high confidence, we propose a novel method, LiPLike, that assumes a regression model and iteratively searches for interactions that cannot be replaced by a linear combination of other predictors. To compare the performance of LiPLike with other available inference methods, we benchmarked LiPLike using three independent datasets from the previous DREAM5 challenge",
