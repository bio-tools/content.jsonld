      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Development and evaluation of a phenotype algorithm evaluator | BACKGROUND:The primary approach for defining disease in observational healthcare databases is to construct phenotype algorithms (PAs), rule-based heuristics predicated on the presence, absence, and temporal logic of clinical observations. However, a complete evaluation of PAs, i.e., determining sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV), is rarely performed. In this study, we propose a tool (PheValuator) to efficiently estimate a complete PA evaluation. METHODS:We used 4 administrative claims datasets: OptumInsight's de-identified Clinformaticsâ„¢ Datamart (Eden Prairie,MN); IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid); IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Beneficiaries; and IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters from 2000 to 2017",
