The pipeline was trialed with Dickeya dianthicola, a destructive broad-host-range bacterial pathogen found in most potato-growing regions. Dickeya is a highly variable genus, and some primers available to detect this genus and species exhibit common diagnostic failures. Upon uploading a selection of target and nontarget genomes, six primer sets were rapidly identified with Uniqprimer, of which two were specific and sensitive when tested with D. dianthicola",
