      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Broad-Host-Range CRISPRi Toolkit for Silencing Gene Expression in Burkholderia | Genetic tools are critical to dissecting the mechanisms governing cellular processes, from fundamental physiology to pathogenesis. Members of the genus Burkholderia have potential for biotechnological applications but can also cause disease in humans with a debilitated immune system. The lack of suitable genetic tools to edit Burkholderia GC-rich genomes has hampered the exploration of useful capacities and the understanding of pathogenic features. To address this, we have developed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology for gene silencing in Burkholderia, testing it in B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans, and B. thailandensis. Tunable expression was provided by placing a codon-optimized dcas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes under control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter",
