  "sc:description": "A neural network based method predicts the real value of surface acessibility (SA) by using multiple sequence alignment. In this method, two feed forward, back-propagation networks are used. The first sequence-to-structure network is trained with PSI-BLAST generated position specific scoring matrices. Further, the initial predictions from the first network and PSIPRED predicted secondary structure are used as input to the second structure-to-structure network.",
