      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SDMs' | Modelling the niches of wild and domesticated Ungulate species using deep learning | Abstract Knowledge of global biodiversity remains limited by geographic and taxonomic sampling biases. The scarcity of species data restricts our understanding of the underlying environmental factors shaping distributions, and the ability to draw comparisons among species. Species distribution models (SDMs) were developed in the early 2000s to address this issue. Although SDMs based on single layered Neural Networks have been experimented with in the past, these performed poorly. However, the past two decades have seen a strong increase in the use of Deep Learning (DL) approaches, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Despite the large improvement in predictive capacity DNNs provide over shallow networks, to our knowledge these have not yet been applied to SDM",
