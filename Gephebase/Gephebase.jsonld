      "sc:description": "database of genotype-phenotype relationships for natural and domesticated variation in Eukaryotes | Gephebase compiles genotype-phenotype relationships, i.e. associations between a mutation and a phenotypic variation. Gephebase consolidates data from the scientific literature about the genes and the mutations responsible for phenotypic variation in Eukaryotes (mostly animals, yeasts and plants). We plan to include non Eukaryote species in the future. For now, genes responsible for human disease and for aberrant mutant phenotypes in laboratory model organisms are excluded and can be found in other databases ( OMIM , OMIA , FlyBase , etc.). QTL mapping studies that did not identify single genes are not included in Gephebase | If you use Gephebase for your publication, please cite: Martin, A., & Orgogozo, V. (2013).
