      "sc:description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'omics', 'digitization', 'collection', 'digitized' | An R Package for Divergence Analysis of Omics Data | Given the ever-increasing amount of high-dimensional and complex omics data becoming available, it is increasingly important to discover simple but effective methods of analysis. Divergence analysis transforms each entry of a high-dimensional omics profile into a digitized (binary or ternary) code based on the deviation of the entry from a given baseline population. This is a novel framework that is significantly different from existing omics data analysis methods: it allows digitization of continuous omics data at the univariate or multivariate level, facilitates sample level analysis, and is applicable on many different omics platforms",
