      "sc:description": "This method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering using a Dirichlet Process to model uncertainty in the data and a Bayesian model selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge. This avoids several limitations of traditional methods, for example how many clusters there should be and how to choose a principled distance metric. This implementation accepts multinomial (i.e. discrete, with 2+ categories) or time-series data.",
