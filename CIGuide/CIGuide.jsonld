      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'robotic', 'hybrid', 'Rhinospider', 'end-effector' | in situ augmented reality laser guidance | PURPOSE : A robotic intraoperative laser guidance system with hybrid optic-magnetic tracking for skull base surgery is presented. It provides in situ augmented reality guidance for microscopic interventions at the lateral skull base with minimal mental and workload overhead on surgeons working without a monitor and dedicated pointing tools. METHODS : Three components were developed: a registration tool (Rhinospider), a hybrid magneto-optic-tracked robotic feedback control scheme and a modified robotic end-effector. Rhinospider optimizes registration of patient and preoperative CT data by excluding user errors in fiducial localization with magnetic tracking",
