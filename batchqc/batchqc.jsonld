This can produce technical biases that can lead to incorrect results. This is a software tool that streamlines batch preprocessing and evaluation by providing interactive diagnostics, visualizations, and statistical analyses to explore the extent to which batch variation impacts the data. Its diagnostics help determine if batch adjustment is needed, and how correction should be applied.",
