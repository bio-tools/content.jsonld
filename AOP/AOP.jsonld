The AOP-KB represents the central repository for all AOPs developed as part of the OECD AOP Development Effort by the Extended Advisory Group on Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics. All AOPs from the AOP Knowledgebase are available via the e.AOP.Portal, which is the primary entry point for the AOP-KB. More information about the AOP-KB efforts, the organizations supporting these efforts, and the other modules of the AOP-KB are available on the About page",
