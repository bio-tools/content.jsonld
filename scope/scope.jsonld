  "sc:description": "Set of programs aimed at identifying novel cis-regulatory elements from groups of upstream sequences. It does not have any nuisance parameters so does not require the user to guess what the results might be. It is also very robust to noisy data and is still 50% as accurate even in the presence of 4-fold noise. It can also identify other genes in the genome that might be coregulated with the original gene set.",
